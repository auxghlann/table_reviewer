## 🧩 Chunk 2: Pornography and OSAEC

### 🔞 Pornography and Technology
Pornography has historically driven the adoption of new communication technologies.
- **Adolescence:** A critical time for constructing sexual selves. Online lives (chat rooms, sexting) play a major role in this development.
- **Business Model:** Cybersex and electronic pornography often "trailblaze" new business practices for the internet economy (Coopersmith, 2006).

### 🔗 The Link to OSAEC
Cybersex and pornography are interrelated. Engagement in one often lures users into the other, sometimes involving victims rather than willing participants.

**OSAEC (Online Sexual Abuse and Exploitation of Children)**
- **A Silent Pandemic:** Save the Children Philippines describes OSAEC as a crisis affecting children's mental health and well-being.
- **Covid-19 Impact:** Cases increased by **264.6%** during the 2020 quarantine compared to 2019.
- **Root Cause:** Deepening poverty forced some families to resort to exploitation for "easy money."

### 🛡️ Legal and Social Responsibility
- **RA 9775:** The Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009.
- **Safer Internet Day:** Advocates for a "Bagong Normal: Ligtas na Internet for All."
- **Duty:** Parents, communities, and students must protect children. As a student committed to Justice and Human Rights, you are called to advocate against this exploitation.
