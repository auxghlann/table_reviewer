## 🧩 Defining Justice & Distribution

### 🏛️ What is Justice?
At its simplest, justice is about **fairness**. It asks: *How should we distribute benefits (rewards) and burdens (punishments/costs) in society?*

* **Aristotle’s Golden Rule of Justice:**
    > "Equals should be treated equally, and unequals unequally."
    * **Translation:** Fairness doesn't mean everyone gets the *exact same thing*. It means if people are different in a *morally relevant way* (like one worked harder, or one is disabled), it is fair to treat them differently.
    * **The Key:** You need a **justifiable reason** for inequality.

### 🚫 The Enemies of Justice
When we treat people unequally *without* a good reason, it becomes unjust.
1.  **Favoritism:** Giving special benefits to someone just because you like them or know them.
2.  **Discrimination:** Imposing burdens on someone who is no different from others (e.g., racism, sexism).

### 🥧 Distributive Justice: Who Gets What?
"Distributive Justice" is the debate on **how** we should share society's resources. There are 5 main theories:

| Theory | Motto | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Egalitarianism** 🤝 | "Everyone gets the same." | Equality of **outcome**. |
| **Capitalist** 💰 | "You get what you earn." | Based on **contribution** and effort. |
| **Socialist** 🛠️ | "From each according to ability, to each according to need." | **Needs** and collective ownership. |
| **Libertarian** 🦅 | "It's mine if I got it legally." | **Freedom** from government interference (Robert Nozick). |
| **Justice as Fairness** ⚖️ | "Fair rules for everyone." | Rules chosen under conditions of **equality** (John Rawls). |

### 🧠 John Rawls: Justice as Fairness
John Rawls is a heavy hitter here. He suggests we imagine a "Original Position" where we don't know if we are rich or poor. From there, we would choose these principles:

1.  **Equal Liberty:** Everyone gets basic rights (speech, freedom).
2.  **The Second Principle (for Inequalities):**
    * **Difference Principle:** Inequality is okay *only if* it helps the **poorest** people.
    * **Fair Opportunity:** Everyone should have an equal shot at success.

> **Essential Concept:** Rawls believes **Self-Respect** is the most important "social good" because without it, we lose the motivation to pursue a good life.

### 🔨 Other Types of Justice
* **Retributive Justice:** Punishment for those who are guilty (e.g., Jail for a crime).
* **Compensatory Justice:** Making wrongdoers pay back their victims (e.g., Paying for a window you broke).
