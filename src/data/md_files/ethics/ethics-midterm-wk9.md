# Week 9: Immanuel Kant’s Ethics

`sleepdeprivedtable`


# 🧠 Part 1: Introduction — The Core of Kantian Ethics

## 🎯 What’s it about?
Kantian Ethics is a **deontological** approach — meaning it focuses on **duty and moral rules**, *not on the consequences* of actions.

> 💬 In short: What matters is *why* you act, not *what happens after*.

---

## ⚙️ Key Idea — The “Good Will”
For Kant, the only truly good thing is **a good will** —  
> the will that acts **for the sake of duty** and **out of respect for moral law**.

So:
- ❌ Doing something good because you *want* praise → **not moral**  
- ✅ Doing something good because it’s your *duty* → **moral**

> Think of it like: doing the right thing *just because it’s right.*

---

## 💡 Universal Law (Categorical Imperative)
Kant says moral actions follow a single universal rule:
> “Act only according to that maxim which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”

This means before you act, ask:
> 🧩 *“What if everyone in the world did this same thing?”*

If the action would create chaos or contradiction — it’s **not moral**.

---

## 🍫 Example — Stealing a Snack
Imagine you’re hungry and steal a snack from a store.  
If you make stealing a “universal law” (everyone steals when hungry),  
➡️ society collapses — no property or trust.  
So, stealing is *not universalizable* → **immoral**.

---

## 🪞 Another Example — Lying to Save a Life
Suppose someone asks you where your friend (Tony) is because they want to hurt him.  
You think lying would save Tony, but Kant says:
> “Lying is always wrong, even for a good reason.”

If you lie and something worse happens (Tony still dies),  
you’ve violated the **moral law**, because truth is a universal duty.  
You must never break it, even for a “good” cause.

---

## 🧩 Why So Strict?
Kant’s ethics can seem cold — but his point is:
- Moral laws apply **equally to everyone**  
- You can’t make exceptions for yourself  
- Actions are moral only if they can hold up as *universal rules*

---

## ⚖️ Two Sides of the Categorical Imperative
Kant gave **two main formulations**:
1. **Universality:** Act only if your action could be a universal law.  
2. **Humanity as an End:** Treat every person as an **end in themselves**, not just a **means to your goals**.

---

## 🧭 Summary Visual

**KANTIAN ETHICS OVERVIEW**
- **Focus:** Duty (Deontological)  
- **Key Concept:** Good Will  
- **Universal Law:** Act only on moral maxims  
- **Examples:** Don’t steal, don’t lie — even for good outcomes  
- **Principle:** Treat people as Ends, not Means  

---

## ⚠️ Kant’s Approach Has Issues
Kant’s theory is powerful but also criticized for:
- Overemphasis on **moral autonomy** (rational duty above emotions)  
- **Ignoring consequences** entirely  
- **Vagueness** in deciding what counts as a moral rule  

Still, his work laid the foundation for **modern moral philosophy** — and it challenges us to ask not *“what works”*, but *“what’s right.”*

# 🧩 Part 2: Means vs. Mere Means  

## 🧠 What’s the Big Idea?

Kant’s **second formulation** says:

> “Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an **end**, and never as a **mere means**.”

That’s a mouthful — so let’s break it down.  

---

## ⚙️ “Means” vs. “Mere Means”

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Means** | Using someone *with their consent* to achieve a goal — still respecting their humanity | Hiring a driver to take you somewhere 🚗 |
| **Mere Means** | Using someone *only* for your own benefit, **without caring** about their goals or consent | Tricking the driver into driving you for free 😬 |

✅ It’s okay to use people as *means* (we all do — teachers, doctors, teammates).  
❌ It’s **never okay** to use them as *mere means* — that’s exploitation.  

---

## 👥 Example — Borrowing Money
You ask to borrow ₱500, claiming it’s for books 📚, but you actually want to buy an Xbox 🎮.  

- If the lender agrees, thinking it’s for books — you’ve **lied**, removing their ability to choose freely.  
- You’ve **used them as a mere means**, because their *rational consent* was manipulated.  

💡 Kant says: lying always blocks autonomy — it turns a person into a tool for your plan.  

---

## 🧭 The Role of Rational Consent

To check if you’re treating someone as a *mere means*, ask:

> “Would this person **rationally consent** to being treated this way if they knew everything?”

If **no**, then you’re using them merely as a means.  

---

## 🧱 Why This Matters

Kant believed:
- Every person is **an end-in-themselves** — they have their own goals and intrinsic worth.  
- Human beings are **autonomous**, meaning they can think, reason, and decide freely.  
- Using someone *without regard to that autonomy* strips them of their dignity.  

So, **respect** is the moral heart of this principle.  

---

## ⚖️ Humanity Principle in Action

**Moral Action:**  
👉 You help a classmate study for the exam because you respect their effort to learn.  

**Immoral Action:**  
🚫 You help them just so they’ll let you copy their project later.  

The difference lies in **intention** — one treats them as an equal, the other as a tool.  

---

## 🌍 In Summary

**The Second Categorical Imperative (Humanity Principle):**
- We can *use* people as means, but never as **mere means**.  
- Always respect others as **rational agents** with goals of their own.  
- Lying, manipulation, and deception violate human dignity.  

---

## 🧠 Quick Visual Summary

**Treating People Right (Kantian Style)**  
- 🤝 People = Ends (Respect autonomy and consent)  
- 🧍‍♀️ Not Tools = Never deceive or manipulate  
- 💬 Ask: “Would they still agree if they knew everything?”  
- 🌱 Morality = Dignity + Freedom + Honesty  


# ⚖️ Part 3: Deontological Ethics  

## 🧠 The Core Idea

“Deontological” comes from the Greek *deon*, meaning **duty**.  
So, **Deontological Ethics** = ethics based on **moral duty**, not outcomes.  

> For Kant, morality isn’t about *what happens* — it’s about *why you did it*.

---

## 💬 In Simple Terms

Kant believed:  
- Some actions are **right or wrong in themselves**, regardless of their consequences.  
- Doing your **duty** is what makes an act moral — not whether it makes you or others happy.

🎯 **Right actions** = those done from **duty**  
🚫 **Wrong actions** = those done from **inclination** (personal gain, feelings, or outcomes)

---

## 📘 Example Scenarios

| Situation | If You Act from Duty | If You Act for Outcome |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| You tell the truth even if it hurts your reputation | ✅ Morally right — because truth-telling is your duty | ❌ Morally weak — you only tell truth if it’s convenient |
| You stay loyal to your spouse even when tempted | ✅ Moral integrity — following duty | ❌ Immoral — if loyalty depends on circumstance |

---

## 💡 “Good Will” Again
Kant says the **only thing good without qualification** is a **good will** —  
not intelligence, wealth, or courage, since those can be used for evil too.

So, a person who chooses the right thing *because it’s right* acts with a **good will**.  
Even if the result turns out badly — the action remains moral.  

> 🗣️ “A good will is good not because of what it accomplishes, but because it *wills rightly*.”

---

## 🧩 Duty Above Desire

You act morally **only** when your decision is guided by reason and principle, not emotions.  

Kant’s test:
> “Would I still do this if it brought me no reward, comfort, or approval?”

If yes → your act is moral.  
If not → it’s just preference or convenience.

---

## 🧱 Kant’s Deontological Formula

1. **Moral worth** comes from intention, not result.  
2. **Duty** is guided by the **Categorical Imperative** (moral law).  
3. **Good will** acts from duty alone.  

---

## ⚔️ Example — Telling the Truth vs. Lying

Imagine you could lie to save yourself from trouble.  

- **Consequentialist View:** Lying is okay if it avoids harm.  
- **Kantian View:** Lying is *always wrong*, because it breaks universal moral law.  

Even if truth-telling causes pain — you’ve done your duty.  
Your integrity remains untouched.  

---

## 🧭 The “Summum Bonum”

Kant said the ultimate human goal is the **Summum Bonum** —  
a perfect union of **virtue** (moral goodness) and **happiness**.

🌟 In a just world:
- Good people deserve happiness because of their virtue.  
- The moral path should *lead* to happiness, even if not immediately.

---

## 🌍 Summary

**Kant’s Deontological Ethics in a Nutshell:**
- 🔹 Morality = Acting from **Duty**, not emotion or consequence  
- 🔹 **Good Will** = Acting because it’s right  
- 🔹 **Categorical Imperative** = The moral compass guiding duty  
- 🔹 **Summum Bonum** = The harmony of virtue and happiness  

---

## 🧠 Quick Visual Summary

**KANT’S DEONTOLOGICAL BLUEPRINT**  
- 🎯 Focus: Duty > Consequences  
- 🧭 Rule: Follow universal moral law  
- 💪 Motive: Good Will, not personal gain  
- 💬 Example: Tell the truth even if it costs you  
- 🌈 Goal: Summum Bonum (Virtue + Happiness)  

# ⚖️ Part 4: Difference Between Hypothetical and Categorical Imperative  

## 🧠 What Are “Imperatives”?  

Kant calls **imperatives** “instructions” — they tell us what we *ought* to do.  
But not all imperatives are equal. Some depend on your *wants*, others on *pure reason*.  

He divides them into two kinds:  
1. 🧩 **Hypothetical Imperative** — “If you want ___, then do ___.”  
2. 🧱 **Categorical Imperative** — “Do this, because it’s the right thing.”  

---

## 1️⃣ Hypothetical Imperative  

These are **conditional** — they apply *only if* you have a certain goal.  

> 🗣️ “If you want to pass the exam, then study.”  
> 🗣️ “If you don’t want to go to jail, don’t steal.”  

Here, the “should” depends on your *desire or circumstance*.  

| Type | Example | Based On | Nature |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Hypothetical** | “If you want to be fit, exercise.” | Personal goals | Conditional, practical |
| **Focus** | *Means to an end* | — | Not moral, just strategic |

💭 Think of it as: “What should I do *if I want* this result?”  
No desire → no duty.  

---

## 2️⃣ Categorical Imperative  

Now, this one’s **unconditional** — it applies to everyone, always.  

> 🗣️ “Tell the truth.”  
> 🗣️ “Don’t steal.”  

These rules hold even if they don’t benefit you or make you happy.  
They come from **pure reason**, not from feelings or goals.  

| Type | Example | Based On | Nature |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Categorical** | “Do not lie.” | Reason, universal duty | Absolute, moral |
| **Focus** | *End in itself* | — | Universally binding |

💡 **No ‘if.’ No ‘but.’ No condition.**  
The rule stands because morality must be **universal** and **consistent**.  

---

## ⚔️ Side-by-Side Comparison  

| Feature | Hypothetical Imperative | Categorical Imperative |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Type of Command** | Conditional | Unconditional |
| **Basis** | Desire or goal | Moral duty |
| **Example** | “If you want friends, be kind.” | “Be kind.” |
| **Who it Applies To** | Only those with that goal | Everyone, always |
| **Purpose** | To achieve something | To do what’s right |
| **Moral Value** | None (depends on self-interest) | Full (rooted in reason) |

---

## 🧭 Categorical Imperative in Practice  

Kant says morality is built on **categorical imperatives**, not hypothetical ones.  

They are like **moral laws** — firm, non-negotiable, universal.  

> 🧠 “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”  

So, before doing anything, test it:  
> “Would it still make sense if *everyone* did the same thing?”  

If yes → moral.  
If no → immoral.  

---

## 🔍 Connection to Religion and Reason  

Kant didn’t rely on divine commands.  
He believed reason alone could identify moral law — a **moral compass within us**.  

He saw categorical imperatives reflected in things like:  
- The **Ten Commandments** 🕊️  
- Universal moral duties like *honesty*, *respect*, and *non-violence*  

These aren’t just religious rules — they’re **rational necessities**.  

---

## 🌈 Summary  

**Hypothetical Imperative:**  
- Conditional → “If you want X, then do Y.”  
- Based on personal desires or goals.  
- Morality = optional, situational.  

**Categorical Imperative:**  
- Unconditional → “Do X, period.”  
- Based on reason and duty.  
- Morality = universal, necessary.  

---

## 🧠 Quick Visual Summary  

**TWO TYPES OF IMPERATIVES (KANTIAN LOGIC)**  
- ⚙️ **Hypothetical:** “If you want to achieve something → act this way.”  
  - Goal-based ✅  
  - Situational ⚠️  
  - Practical, not moral  
- 🧭 **Categorical:** “Act this way because it’s right.”  
  - Universal 🌍  
  - Reason-based 💡  
  - Moral and absolute
