## 🧩 Chunk 1 — Culture and Moral Development

### 🧠 **Moral Agency & The Role of Culture**
A **Moral Agent** is a being capable of distinguishing right from wrong and is accountable for their actions.
* Human beings are moral agents.
* **Crucial Point:** Moral consciousness is *not* innate; it develops through interaction with society.

> "People make culture, but culture also makes people."

**Culture shapes how we:**
1.  Judge right and wrong.
2.  Respond to moral issues.
3.  Form our conscience and reasoning.

**According to Allan G. Johnson, Culture is:**

## 🧩 Chunk 2 — 🌍 Cultural Relativism

### 💡 **Core Definition**
**Cultural Relativism** is the view that a person’s beliefs and values should be understood *within their own culture*, rather than judged against the standards of another.

**The Relativist View:**
* **No Universal Truth:** Truth is not absolute; it depends on the subject/culture.
* **Maxim:** "What is true to you may not be true to me."
* **Moral Implication:** An act is "right" if the society approves of it.
    * *Example:* Suicide is immoral in the Philippines but was considered honorable in wartime Japan.

### 🤚 **The Five Claims of Cultural Relativism**
1.  Different societies have different moral codes.
2.  The moral code of a society determines what is right within that society.
3.  There is no objective, universal moral truth.
4.  No society’s moral code has special status over another.
5.  Judging other cultures is arrogant; we should be tolerant.
