## 🧩 Chunk 1: Foundations of Morality

### 💭 What is Morality?
At its core, morality is a set of **social conventions** about right and wrong that form a consensus.
* **The Purpose:** It acts as a **"survival script"** for daily living. Just like actors follow a script to make a movie work, humans follow moral rules to make society work.
* **The Result:** Following this script builds virtues like **love, compassion, and justice**, which ultimately shapes your character.

> **Key Insight:** Humans don't live randomly. Life follows a "script," and shared rules are vital for our survival.

### 🌍 Does Morality Change?
Yes and No! Morality is a mix of **universals** and **variations**.

#### 1. The Variations (It Depends!)
What is considered "right" can vary based on many factors:
* **Culture & Ethnicity:** What is polite in Japan might be rude in the USA.
* **Religion:** different faiths have different dietary or behavioral laws.
* **Age & Experience:** Your moral compass changes as you grow up.

#### 2. The Universals (The Constants)
Despite our differences, some acts are **universally condemned** across almost all cultures:
* ❌ Murder 
* ❌ Theft 
* ❌ Arson

### 📜 Two Types of "Rules of Conduct"
James Moor (2004) categorized the rules we follow into two main types.

| Type | Description | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Directive** 👮‍♂️ | These are **authoritative orders** from the government. They are **legally binding** and come with penalties if you break them. | • Laws<br/>• Ordinances<br/>• Regulations  |
| **2. Social Policy** 🏥 | These are **broad frameworks** designed to fix complex social problems. They promote **social justice, equity, and inclusion**. | • Welfare programs<br/>• Healthcare systems<br/>• Education reforms  |

> **Analogy:** Think of **Directives** as the "Red Light" you *must* stop at (or you get a ticket). Think of **Social Policy** as the government deciding to "Build a Highway" to help everyone travel better.

## 🧩 Chunk 2: The Moral System and Codes

### 🏗️ What Makes a "Moral System"? (Bernard Gert)
A moral system isn't random. It has a clear structure designed to **prevent harm** and **promote human happiness**.

**The 4 Essential Characteristics:**
| Feature | Explanation | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 📢 **Public** | Everyone knows the rules. | "Do not kill" is universal knowledge. |
| 🤝 **Informal** | No official judges or courts. | We use social pressure, not jail, for rudeness. |
| 🧠 **Rational** | Based on logic/reason. | Rules make sense for survival. |
| ⚖️ **Impartial** | Applies equally to all. | No one is "above" morality. |
