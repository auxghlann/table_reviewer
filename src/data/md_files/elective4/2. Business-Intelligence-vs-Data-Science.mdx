## 🧩 Chunk 1: Overview of Business Intelligence vs Data Science

### 🧠 Why This Comparison Matters
At first glance, **Business Intelligence (BI)** and **Data Science** look similar because:
- Both work with data
- Both aim to generate insights
- Both support decision-making

But their **purpose, questions, and outputs** are different.

Understanding the distinction prevents a very common mistake:
> Treating BI and Data Science as interchangeable — they are not.

---

### 🌐 Shared Goal, Different Paths
Both BI and Data Science aim to:
- Extract value from data
- Support better decisions
- Improve organizational outcomes

However, they differ in:
- **Focus**
- **Methodologies**
- **Time orientation**
- **Type of insights produced**

🧠 Think of them as **complementary**, not competing.

---

### 📊 High-Level Difference (Intuition First)

- **Business Intelligence (BI)** asks:
  > “What happened and how are we performing?”

- **Data Science** asks:
  > “What will happen and why?”

BI looks **backward and inward**.  
Data Science looks **forward and exploratory**.

---

### 🔍 Role in Today’s Organizations
